# Waizza GUI

Waizza GUI is a simple GUI system for the [Defold](https://defold.com) game engine. It is inspired by [Unity3D](https://unity.com) Gui components.

Defold doesn't provide complex gui components. I used Unity3D for a long time and I wanted a gui library it's ready to use and more familiar to me. So I developed a reusable GUI library inspired by Unity3D. There are other great GUI libraries such as [Gooey](https://github.com/britzl/gooey), [DirtyLarry](https://github.com/andsve/dirtylarry).

#### Supported Components
- Button
- Input (text, password)

The demo project provides code samples for all possible use cases.
